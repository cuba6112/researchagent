# Forgetting LabAn autonomous AI scientist built with Google ADK that researches catastrophic forgetting in neural networks through iterative hypothesis-critique-experiment cycles.## Features- **Autonomous Research Cycles**: Generates hypotheses, critiques them, runs experiments, and analyzes results- **Multi-Agent Pipeline**: Specialized agents (Theorist, Critic, Gatekeeper, Architect, Analyst, etc.)- **Persistent Memory**: Tracks insights, failures, and research history across sessions- **Report Generation**: Produces scientific papers from accumulated research- **Browser Research**: Optional Playwright integration for web research## Requirements- Python 3.12+- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)- Google Gemini API key## Installation```bash# Clone the repositorygit clone https://github.com/cuba6112/researchagent.gitcd researchagent# Install dependencies with uvuv sync# Set up your Gemini API keycp ika_agent/.env.example ika_agent/.env# Edit ika_agent/.env and add your key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey```## Usage```bash# Run with ADK CLIuv run adk run ika_agent# Run with web interfaceuv run adk web ika_agent```### Optional: Browser ResearchFor computer use capabilities:```bash# Install Playwright browsersuv run playwright install chromium```## Project Structure```researchagent/├── ika_agent/│   ├── agent.py                 # Core agent definitions│   ├── playwright_computer.py   # Browser automation│   └── outputs/                 # Research history and reports├── pyproject.toml└── CLAUDE.md                    # Claude Code guidance```## Models- Standard agents: `gemini-3-flash-preview`- Computer use: `gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025`## AuthorJose Munoz (cuba6112@gmail.com)## LicenseMIT
