# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) project implementing "Forgetting Lab" - an autonomous AI scientist for researching catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. The agent runs iterative research cycles: hypothesis generation, critique, experimentation, and analysis.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the agent via ADK CLI
adk run ika_agent

# Run with web interface
adk web ika_agent

# Install Playwright browsers (required for computer use)
playwright install chromium
```

## Architecture

### Agent Pipeline (`ika_agent/agent.py`)

The system uses Google ADK's SequentialAgent to chain specialized agents in a research cycle:

1. **Theorist** - Generates falsifiable hypotheses about catastrophic forgetting
2. **Critic** - Attacks hypotheses ruthlessly to find flaws
3. **Gatekeeper** - Makes PROCEED/REVISE/REJECT decisions
4. **Architect** - Designs minimal runnable experiments (has code executor)
5. **Analyst** - Provides honest numerical analysis of results
6. **Teacher** - Explains findings in simple terms
7. **Editor** - Reviews for scientific rigor
8. **Memory Saver** - Persists findings to disk

Additional standalone agents:
- **Reporter** - Generates scientific papers from accumulated research
- **Synthesizer** - Analyzes patterns across multiple research cycles
- **Browser Researcher** - Uses Playwright for web research (optional)

### Memory System

Persistent memory stored in `outputs/`:
- `memory.json` - Research history, insights, and failures
- `reports/` - Generated papers and summaries

The `MemoryManager` singleton provides thread-safe and process-safe access to memory with file-level locking.

### Experiment Versioning System

The `ExperimentVersionManager` saves reproducible experiment snapshots in `outputs/experiments/`:

Each experiment captures:
- **Code snapshot** - Exact Python code that was run (with SHA256 hash)
- **Random seeds** - Auto-extracted from code patterns
- **Hyperparameters** - Auto-extracted (lr, batch_size, epochs, etc.)
- **Environment** - Python, PyTorch, NumPy versions, git commit
- **Results** - Full execution output

Commands available through root agent:
- `list experiments` - Show all saved experiment versions
- `show experiment <id or cycle>` - Display experiment details
- `compare experiments <id1> <id2>` - Diff two experiments
- `rerun experiment <id>` - Get command to re-run

The Memory Saver agent automatically saves experiment versions after each successful cycle.

### Metrics Tracking System

The `MetricsTracker` singleton tracks experiment metrics over time for trend analysis:

- **Automatic extraction** - Parses accuracy, loss, forgetting, delta, baseline from experiment output
- **Tagging** - Tag experiments with method categories (ewc, replay, sam, etc.)
- **Trend analysis** - Track metrics over cycles, compute statistics
- **Progress dashboard** - Summary of research progress with trends

Commands available through root agent:
- `dashboard` / `progress` - Show research progress dashboard
- `trends <metric>` - Show trends for accuracy, loss, forgetting, etc.
- `tag experiment <id> <tags>` - Add tags to an experiment
- `find by tag <tag>` - Find experiments with a specific tag

Metrics are automatically recorded by the Memory Saver agent after each experiment.

### Computer Use (`ika_agent/playwright_computer.py`)

Custom `PlaywrightComputer` implementation that wraps Playwright's sync API in a ThreadPoolExecutor to avoid Windows asyncio subprocess issues. Implements the ADK `BaseComputer` interface for browser automation.

### Models

**DO NOT CHANGE THE MODEL without user permission.**

- Standard agents: `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- Computer use agent: `gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025` (no Gemini 3 version yet)

## Key Patterns

- All agents use `output_key` to pass data through the pipeline via session state
- Custom `FunctionTool` wrappers expose memory operations to agents
- The root `forgetting_lab` agent orchestrates cycles and handles user commands
- Research cycles auto-save via the `memory_saver` agent at the end of each cycle
