  "hypothesis": "The previously observed failure of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in Experience Replay (Cycle 2) was primarily caused by the interaction between \"Batch Normalization noise\" and \"New-Task Gradient Dominance\"; combining SAM with a Group Normalization and Weight Standardization (GN+WS) backbone and a \"Balanced-Gradient\" perturbation\u2014where the SAM perturbation $\\epsilon$ is computed from the sum of the unit-normalized mean gradients of the current task and the replay buffer\u2014will yield a 1.5% improvement in final average accuracy on SplitCIFAR-10 compared to the current best-performing baseline.",
